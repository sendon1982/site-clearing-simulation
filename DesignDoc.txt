# site-clearing-simulation

1. My idea is to have a class called "Block" which will have position (of the site), clearedBefore(indicate if this area is
cleared before), landType (include tree, plain, rocky or reserved tree).

2. Scan the map to get "Block" detail information and record total quantity of squares because we need to print them.

3. Receive valid steps from command line and save as a list of class "Step"

4. Loop all the steps based on the command. If command is changing direction, then figure out where bulldozer will move.
After that, increase or decrease row index or column index. Also, make sure they are not out of boundary which will terminate
the program.

4. Since bulldozer is facing east and outside of site, move one step to put bulldozer into position (0,0) first. Then check
information of that block, if it is not reserved, record fuel usage, mark that block is visited, clear square minus one,
as well as possible damage to bulldozer.

5. Loop all the steps and update information inside class "ClearingCost" and print the result.
